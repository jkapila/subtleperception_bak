Hello All to my first Blog!
{{< /typeit >}}

<!--more-->
As this is my first blog post, I just want to give a brief intro to what is this Blog all about.

By ***Subtle Perceptions***, *I* mean to induce thought, a viewpoint, an angle of looking at, an approach to ponder on;
from which we can deduce multiple things from a single concept.
 
So the biggest question why do we need it (or is it really necessary! Uh!). Well let's walk through a few examples.
 
So let's suppose you are in a grocery store. Obviously since you are in a store, you will buy the grocery here. But Wait !!! Is that you _really_ do every time you go there..??? So suppose while walking across the store you start to think there is a party next weekend. You must be thinking now "Should I prepare roasted or baked". Now your choice is not yours. You will start to ponder from likes and dislikes of the close ones you want to invite. 
 
 And now if you are or you are not a Data Science freak you'll do two things, segmentation, and classification. 
 
 Wait a sec! Where the heck do these come into a grocery store and What is [Segmentation and Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification) ??!!!
 
With all respect I ain't saying Segmentation and Classification are different, but the usage and output define the name you give to it. So in our story *You Will Segment your Close Ones* based on their requirement so that you can make them happy. And *You'll Classify the Products in Grocery Store* to meet those requirements. Asin you might have a friend who gets indigestion pretty fast. Then your preparation will be easy to digest, kinda high fiber dish. And if there are kids then chocolate is a must. 
 
 So you getting me, a simple ***Perception of Segmentation / Classification / Stratified / Target Approach*** you just used 
 at a grocery store without even knowing it.
 
 Hmm lets again walk to say a park nearby.
 
 Now the clause "nearby" and "walking to park" both have heavy viewpoints. Nearby can be a continuous variable in miles/kms/feet which you regress based on your capacity to walk. For a lazy lad its value may just 10 feet and for a pro-Athlete its easy 10 kms. Doing that one regression is damn easy for most of us, but do we realize we are doing it ?!
 
 Now what is [**Regression**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) ??!!!
 
 Hey but we forgot about the park. So the park chosen for a walk can also be **classified** based on a person's age, needs, and health. If a person is a kid the playground is what they will look at, and if he is an old man he might need some folks of his age nearby. So the ***Person*** will **classify the park and regress the distance** he can walk and then based on his mood will go or can drop in front of the TV for a soccer match.
 
 Again the **Person** just used ***Perception of Regression with Classification*** to solve his purpose.
 
In amazing ways, we use these simple things so efficiently that we don't even realize how much more we can explore with them. And hence I am just **making an attempt** to put forward my perceptions to see how much I can contribute to anyone who reads this.

Well, thanks for reading and hope you'll find something useful here.

***Till Next Time, Have A Great Time.***
