{{< typeit id="excerpt" >}}
During my course for learning Data Science over time, I have collected and referred my perspectives in following papers.

> Unique Metric for Health Analysis with Optimization of Clustering Activity and Cross Comparison of Results from Different Approach. [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03419)

* A method for estimating clusters **holistically**. The *metric* dose not depend on any assumptions about the *Approach to Cluster* the ***Data***. All that matters is the **Data** what it fits on and what are the **Cluster Segments** observed.

> Reinforcement Evolutionary Learning Method for Self-Learning (RELM).[Paper Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328160390_Reinforcement_Evolutionary_Learning_Method_for_self-learning)  

* ***RELM*** is a take on using **Reinforcement Learning** on **Quantitative Data** where learning happens via Evolutionary Algorithms (GA, ES, NES, NSGA-II, etc). This method takes on the challenge age old problem of Concept Drift.  

> Futuristic Classification with Dynamic Reference Frame Strategy.[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10168)  

* As a Data science practitioner, one of the classical problem is to understand The ***Churn***. This paper takes a perspective on data that enables to identify what actually distinguishes **Churn from Other**.   


> Personalized Influence Estimation Technique(PIE). [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10940)  

* We have lot of methods to access the *global influence* of a variable in data for most of *ML Algorithms*. But to make a ***justifiable point estimate*** about a datum might be a key source of information in many cases of *Anomaly detection, Churn Analysis or Employee Attrition Reduction, etc..* Individual PIE values (point estimates) can be used to trigger a certain action. In this paper we estimate PIE values for **Linear and Non Linear models**. 



    
> Distribution Assertive Regression (DAR). [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01618) and  [Blog Post]({{< ref "/posts/adaptive-regression" >}})

* ***DAR*** is regression analysis in which we understand how a *fit* of regression varies over it's value. In this paper we resolve the **Regression in Parts** and estimate the new data based on *heuristic* methods like K-nearest Neighbor and Regression Equation.
