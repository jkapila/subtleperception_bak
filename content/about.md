As ***Lao Tzu*** says:  
<br />
_If you want to shrink something, you must first allow it to expand.  
If you want to get rid of something, you must first allow it to flourish.  
If you want to take something, you must first allow it to be given.  
This is called the **subtle perception** of the way things are._  
<br />
_The soft overcomes the hard. The slow overcomes the fast.  
Let your workings remain a mystery. Just show people the results._
<br />

Well I am born and bought up in *Bhilai, C.G* (a Tire-II City of ***India***). A guy who just loved to look around and **Observe**. Though at a very young age it just made me lose my interest in standard schooling and constrained studies, yet it's the exactly same thing that has helped me build my career.

I have graduated as a **Mechanical Engineer**, completed my **Post Grads in Thermal Engineering** which eventually took a twisted turn to make me ***Dive into Data Science***. I am presently working with _Ascena Retail GIC_, as _Senior Data Scientist_, where I am responsible to create End-to-End analytical solutions that help **The Business** make ***Informed Decisions***.


I have worked on various projects from _Retail Analytics_ to _Fault Detection_ to _Forecasting_. Over the years my understanding of various concepts in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** has gained those _Eyes of Observations_. This blog is my attempt to make those concepts more intuitive and easy, yet it would help you to form the basis of ***The Work*** we do that creates an ***Impact***.


***Till next time, stay observant, stay crazy, stay safe, stay healthy.***
